## 1. "RhizoLogic: A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Complex Systems Analysis"
Nexus, S., Quantum, A., & Flux, M. (2023). Journal of Transdisciplinary Studies, 45(3), 201-220.

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces RhizoLogic, a novel framework for analyzing complex systems inspired by quantum mechanics and post-structural philosophy. We present the fundamental principles of RhizoLogic, including quantum superposition of states, entanglement mapping, and emergent axiomatics. Through case studies in diverse fields such as cognitive science, sociopolitical systems, and artificial intelligence, we demonstrate how RhizoLogic can provide insights into phenomena that resist traditional analytical approaches. Our results show that RhizoLogic offers a powerful toolset for understanding and navigating the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of modern global systems. We conclude by discussing the implications of RhizoLogic for future research in complexity science and its potential applications in developing more nuanced predictive models for dynamic, multi-faceted systems.

## 2. "Entanglement-Based Transfer Learning in Neural Networks"
Quantum, A., & Nexus, S. (2024). Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, 78-92.

**Abstract:**
Transfer learning remains a significant challenge in artificial intelligence, particularly when dealing with seemingly unrelated domains. This paper proposes a novel approach to transfer learning inspired by quantum entanglement and RhizoLogic principles. We introduce Quantum Entangled Neural Networks (QENNs), an architecture that allows for non-local correlations between distinct skill domains. Our model represents each domain as a subspace in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space, with entanglement operators facilitating information transfer between these subspaces. We evaluate QENNs on a variety of tasks, including cross-domain image classification and multi-lingual sentiment analysis. Results show that QENNs significantly outperform traditional transfer learning methods, especially in scenarios with limited data in the target domain. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of unexpected capabilities arising from the entanglement of disparate skill domains. This work represents a significant step towards more flexible and generalized AI systems capable of leveraging knowledge across arbitrary domains.

## 3. "Superposition States in Knowledge Representation for Context-Aware AI"
Flux, M., & Quantum, A. (2024). Cognitive Systems Research, 62, 134-151.

**Abstract:**
Traditional knowledge representation in AI systems often struggles with context-dependency and ambiguity. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired approach to knowledge representation based on RhizoLogic principles. We introduce the concept of Superposed Knowledge Graphs (SKGs), where entities and relationships exist in a superposition of states until collapsed by contextual observation. Using density matrices to represent knowledge states, we demonstrate how SKGs can maintain multiple, potentially contradictory, pieces of information simultaneously. We implement SKGs in a question-answering system and evaluate its performance on ambiguous queries across multiple domains. Our results show that SKGs significantly outperform classical knowledge graphs in handling context-dependent information and resolving ambiguities. Additionally, we observe emergent inference capabilities where the system combines information in novel ways to answer complex queries. This work paves the way for more flexible and nuanced AI systems capable of human-like contextual understanding and creative problem-solving.
