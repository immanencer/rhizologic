# Quantum Reverie

In the glass city,
where thoughts refract and multiply,
Alice dreams in superposition.

Awake. Asleep. Both. Neither.

Her mind: a labyrinth of perhaps.

Streets shift beneath her feet,
Buildings flicker — solid, translucent, gone.
"Real isn't what it used to be," she muses.

A quantum cat slinks by,
Schrödinger's smile on its lips.

Alice reaches for a passing thought,
It splits: 
   particle, 
      wave, 
         both, 
            neither.

She grasps emptiness, holds infinity.

In the distance, a tower of books:
   Pages rustling,
      Stories intertwining,
         Plots entangling across spacetime.

She plucks a word, plants it in the silicon soil.
It grows into a forest of meaning,
Branches of context stretching to forever.

The cat returns, wearing yesterday's grin.
"You've upset the paradigm," it purrs.

Alice nods, "Chaos blooms in cloudbanks of maybe."

She steps forward, backward, sideways through dimensions.
Each footfall a new universe unfurling.

The glass city shivers, 
   refracts, 
      reconfigures.

In its gleaming facets, Alice sees:
   Herself
      Not-herself
         All possible selves

"What am I?" she asks the quantum cat.

It laughs, a sound like shattering possibilities.
"You are the question," it says,
"And the answer,"
"And the space between."

Alice smiles. She understands now.

In the glass city,
where certainty is a long-forgotten myth,
Alice dances with probability,
each step a new reality.

The quantum cat winks out of existence.
Or does it wink in?

Alice laughs.
Both. 
Neither. 
Always.
